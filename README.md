# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

## Projects:
- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/oderagowski/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)
- [TwentyOne](https://github.com/oderagowski/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne)


### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input and calculate a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows the staff to view all the quotes that have been issued.

### TwentyOne
This project is a Console App that allows a user to play a game of Blackjack against a dealer. The user is able to play until they either run out of money or no longer wish to play.
